"""
This is a python script that will discover the unpartitioned drives on a node,
format them by partitioning and creating a filesystem for them. Both the
partition and the filesystem will then be identically labelled in the format
x"h"z where:

    x = 8 characters representing the ip address of the node in hex
    z = 3 digits representing the disk number

The script will aslo allow the operator to chose individual options to perform
to the disks with different parameters such as:

    --check -c
    --mount -m
    --label -l
    --partition -p
    --all -a

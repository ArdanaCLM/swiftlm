Standalone Script Setup
=======================

Standalone scripts are placed in the `swiftlm/cli` directory.

To install the script it must be added to the `console_scripts`
section in `setup.py`::

    console_scripts=[
        'swiftlm-new-script = swiftlm.cli.new_script:main'
    ]

Scripts must have the prefix `swiftlm` to be installed correctly.
They should also have no file extension and use hyphens to separate words.

After the install the ansible playbooks will symlink anything in the created
anything with the correct prefix to `/usr/local/bin`.  This means that all
the swift scripts will be in `$PATH` and can be quickly called from the
command line.

Scripts should be run as standalone programs::

    $ swift-drive-provision
      # Or if /usr/local/bin is not in $PATH
    $ /usr/local/bin/swift-drive-provision

Attempting to run the script with python will cause errors and should
not be done::

    $ python /usr/local/bin/swift-drive-provision
      # This would cause the script to fail.
